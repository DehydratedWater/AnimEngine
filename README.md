## Description
This is the repository of a vector animation program. I started it as one of my hobbyistic projects in Java when I was in high school. Unfortunately, in the process, it has grown and become my main task for the next few months. I've never finished it, but I've implemented half of the planned functionality.  Even so, I think it's... something. It was my biggest project back then, and even if it's code wasn't the prettiest and solutions the clearest I am still proud of what I was able to push throw with my level of knowledge at the time
